# MONGODB CRUD using Spring Boot 


## Review
  This project's end is to create a CRUD application using Spring Boot and MongoDB. We use the REST API, Mongo, Web and Lombok dependencies for Maven. 
  The CRUD will function over the entity Person
  
  1. First create a new poject with an hexagonal structure, and the Person entity 
  
  2. Create the Respository interface which extend the MongoRepository<T, ID> interface and which'll provide the necessary methods for the CRUD operations
